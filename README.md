# 🌸 A Rakhi Gift for my sister

This is a handcrafted portfolio website, created as a Raksha Bandhan gift for my lovely sister, **Tulsi**.  
Just like the sacred Tulsi plant, this project symbolizes purity, protection and devotion—blending technology with tradition.  
It’s a digital tribute to her strength, spirit and the bond we share.

## 🎁 Why Tulsi?

Raksha Bandhan is more than a ritual—it's a promise. This portfolio is my way of saying:  
> “I see you. I admire you. And I’ll always be here for you.”

May this gift grow with her journey, offering visibility to her talents and serenity to her digital presence.

### 🌿 From My Heart

- There’s not much happiness in my life, so I cherish the little things.
- I feel joy when someone appreciates me.
- I smile when people share food with me.
- I feel warmth when someone speaks to me kindly and respectfully.
- I treasure moments when people treat me like I matter.
- And I felt something truly special when you said:  
  > “You are my brother, and you have a right over me.”  
  That moment meant more than words can express.

> This portfolio is not just a gift—it’s a reflection of that feeling, that bond and that quiet joy I carry in my heart.
