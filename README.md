# 🌸 Tulsi — A Rakhi Gift for Tulsi Gupta

This is a handcrafted portfolio website, created as a Raksha Bandhan gift for my sister, **Tulsi Gupta**.  
Just like the sacred Tulsi plant, this project symbolizes purity, protection and devotion—blending technology with tradition.  
It’s a digital tribute to her strength, spirit and the bond we share.

## 🎁 Why Tulsi?

Raksha Bandhan is more than a ritual—it's a promise. This portfolio is my way of saying:  
> “I see you. I admire you. And I’ll always be here for you.”

May this gift grow with her journey, offering visibility to her talents and serenity to her digital presence.
